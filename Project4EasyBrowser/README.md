**Start Date: June 5, 2019  
End Date: September 13, 2019**

I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Easy Browser"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/4/overview). It creates a simple game where the player must name the country that the flag represents. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Easy Browser" app

**Day 1 - June 30, 2019**

The web view loads Google.com by default and there is a pop-up window with the option to select from 3 websites. Swipe navigation to go forwards or backwards in the history is available.

I continued working on the browser project in the evening. I add a tool bar to the bottom for backward/forward navigation, a loading progress bar, a share button (my own addition) and a refresh button. There is also a feature that blocks unknown hosting names and an alert pops up if a clicked link is blocked.
