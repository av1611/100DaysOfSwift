I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["SwiftSearcher"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/32/overview). This app presents the projects from "Hacking with Swift" as a table view and shows each project individually using `SFSafariViewController`. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "SwiftSearcher" app

**Day 1 - September 18, 2019**

We started the app by making a standard table view. However, we set the cells to be self-adjusting to fit the entire text for the cell's label. We all used `NSAttributedStrings` to make the cell titles look better.
