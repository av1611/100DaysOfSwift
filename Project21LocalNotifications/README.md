I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Local Notifications"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/21/overview). This app is designed to teach me about local notifications. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Local Notifications" app

**Day 1 - July 19, 2019**

I finished the introduction to sending and responding to local notifications.
