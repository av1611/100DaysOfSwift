I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Space Race"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/17/overview). This app is designed to teach me about using MapKit. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Space Race" app

I got a fresh Xcode game project set-up. Nothing to show just yet.
