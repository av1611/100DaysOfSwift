I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

I am starting by working through ["The Swift Programming Language"](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language-swift-5-0/id881256329) book from Apple.

## Log

**Day 1: June 5, 2019:** I have begun the introduction to Swift. We have covered the standard variables types, flow control, and the basics of functions and closures.

**Day 2: June 6, 2019:** We were introduced to classes, enums, and structs. While I know these are important in OOP, I have very little experience with them, so I made sure to understand the basics.
