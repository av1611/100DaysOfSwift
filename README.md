**Start Date: June 5, 2019  
End Date: September 13, 2019**

I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

I am starting by working through ["The Swift Programming Language"](https://books.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language-swift-5-0/id881256329) book from Apple.

## Log

**Day 1 - June 5, 2019:** I have begun the introduction to Swift. We have covered the standard variables types, flow control, and the basics of functions and closures.

**Day 2 - June 6, 2019:** We were introduced to classes, enums, and structs. While I know these are important in OOP, I have very little experience with them, so I made sure to understand the basics.

**Day 3 - June 7, 2019:** We finished "A Swift Tour" and are now working through the language guide. The tour ended with protocols and error handling. So far, the language guide is covering the basics of variables and constants.

**Day 4 - June 8, 2019:** We finished the basics of numerics, booleans, and tuples. I worked for a second hour and covered optionals and finished up the chapter on basics. I completed a third hour where I learned about the basic operators available in Swift.

**Day 5 - June 9, 2019:** Began the chapter of the language guide on Strings and Characters. Among other features of Strings in Swift, I learned about Unicode characters, indexing, and adding and removing characters.

**Day 6 - June 10, 2019:** Finished up Strings and Characters and moved on to Collection Types (arrays, sets, and dictionaries). Covered arrays and sets.

**Day 7 - June 11, 2019:** I learned about dictionaries to finish up the Collection Types chapter. I has starting the Control Flow chapter, learning about for loops, while loops, if-else statements, and switch-case statements. I finished off the day with an additional short session on control transfer statement (eg. `continue`, `break`, etc.) and on guard statements, an interesting tool that I have never seen before.

**Day 8 - June 12, 2019:** I began the chapter on Functions learning about the many options for defining and naming parameters, how to return mutliple paramters, and use in-out paramters (I've seen the `&param` in C++ before, but didn't know what it was doing).

**Day 9 - June 13, 2019:** I finished up functions by learning how Swift defines and leverages their type. I have almost completed the next chapter on Closures; though it is a short chapter, the concepts were very new to me, so I had to slow down.

**Day 10 - June 14, 2019:** Learned about enumerations, an entirely new subject for me. They seem very useful through, especially in OOP.

**Day 11 - June 15, 2019:** I worked through the (suprizingly short) chapter on Classes and Structures. I have started the Properties chapter loearning about properties of classes and structures - this is the farthest I have gome into OOP.

**Day 12 - June 16, 2019:** I learned about structure, enumeration, and class properties, including stored, lazy stored, computed, and type properties. I began the chapter on Methods, learning about instance methods in classes and mutating instance methods for structures and enumerations. I came back to this for some extra coding in the evening and finished the section on Methods, learning about type methods.

**Day 13 - June 17, 2019:** Covered inheritance of classes and how to create custom subscript behavior for a class. I have started the chapter in intializers for classes, structures, and enumerations, though have only touched the basics.

**Day 14 - June 18, 2019:** Still working through initializers; I covered initializer delegation and inheritance today, finishing it failable initializers. I completed a second hour in the evening and finished up the initialization chapter. I then completed the deinitialization chapter and began the chapter on optional chaining.

**Day 15 - June 19, 2019:** Finished up optional chaining; I understood everything I read, but I think this will take some getting used to in real life - it's another thing to keep in mind while programming. I also started error handling.

**Day 16 - June 20, 2019:** I did *not* get in a full hour today - busy and late day in lab - but I'll make up for it tomorrow. I did finish up error handling and will be starting type casting.

**Day 17 - June 21, 2019:** Covered type casting - I was suprized to learn about the seemingly flippant `Any` and `AnyObject` types. I also covered nested types where enums or structs can be nested within others and called using subscript dot syntax. Finally, I began extensions which seem like a very powerful feature.

**Day 18 - June 22, 2019:** Finished up extensions where I learned how to add methods, subscripts, and nested types to existing types. I then bagan the section on protocols.

**Day 19 - June 23, 2019:** Still working on protocols (one more section left). Today I covered extending an already existing type to conform to a protocol, defining collection types as protocols, protocol inheritance, class-only protocols, protocol composition, checking for conformance, and optional requirements (which may be obvious from the oxymoronic name, seems to defeat the purpose of protocols).
