I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Capital Cities"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/16/overview). This app is designed to teach me about using MapKit. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Capital Cities" app

**Day 1 - July 15, 2019**

It was a  pretty simple project that taught me about MapKit. I learned about how to add pins and modify their pop-ups when tapped, including adding text and buttons (along with their selector functions). I also modified the pin colors to be randomly chosen. There is a navigation button to change the type of map view.
