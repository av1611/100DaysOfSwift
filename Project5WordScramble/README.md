I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Word Scramble"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/5/overview). It creates a simple anagram game and lets the user input words that can be constructed from the provided word. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Easy Browser" app

**Day 1 - July 1, 2019**

The title presents a word for the user to submit anagrams of. Then the submitted answers are checked against three criteria: is the word a real word, has it already been used, and can it be constructed from the prodivided word. I demonstrate all three possible failures in the example below.
