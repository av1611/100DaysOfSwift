**Start Date: June 5, 2019  
End Date: September 13, 2019**

I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Selfie Share"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/25/overview). This app is designed to teach me about using `MultipeerConnectivity`, a library for quickly sharing data between multiple devices. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Selfie Share" app

**Day 1 - July 25, 2019**

I created an app that loads images from the Photos library and shares them to all connected devices. In the example, I create a network between the iOS Simulator and my iPhone 6S, using the iPhone as the host. I then load an image from the library, and it instantly appears on the simulator. The same can be done in other direction, too.
