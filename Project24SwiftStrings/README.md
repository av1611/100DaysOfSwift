I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example Swift playground produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Swift Strings"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/24/overview). This playground is a designed to teach me all about strings and `NSAttributedString`.
