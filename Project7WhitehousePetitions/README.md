I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Whitehouse Petitions"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/7/overview). This is an app to interface with the petitions submitted to "We the people" Whitehouse peitions in the USA. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Guess the Flag" app

**Day 1 - July 2, 2019**

The app interfaces with the Whitehouse We the People API and downloads the most recent and most popular petitions, presenting the results as a scrollable table.

I completed the challenges: 1) add a credits pop-up, 2) add more information to each petition detailed view, 3) allow for filtering by the petition titles.
