I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Whitehouse Petitions"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/7/overview). This is an app to interface with the petitions submitted to "We the people" Whitehouse peitions in the USA. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

The app was returned to in Project 9 to enable a feature where the data is fetched in the background so that the UI isn't locked up in the mean time. This project is called ["Grand Central Dispatch"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/9/overview) and the goal is to learn how to run complex tasks in the background with GCD.

## Daily progress of "Whitehouse Petitions" app

**Day 1 - July 2, 2019**

The app interfaces with the Whitehouse We the People API and downloads the most recent and most popular petitions, presenting the results as a scrollable table.

I completed the challenges: 1) add a credits pop-up, 2) add more information to each petition detailed view, 3) allow for filtering by the petition titles.

**Day 2 - July 3, 2019**

Downloading and parsing the petitions is done in the background. There isn't anything new to demonstrate visually.

**Day 3 - July 4, 2019**

The filtering processes are also conducted in the background.
