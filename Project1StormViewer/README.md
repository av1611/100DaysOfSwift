End Date: September 13, 2019**

I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) call ["Storm Viewer"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/1/overview). It creates a scrollable list of images (of storms from a national database). I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Storm Viewer" app

**Day 1 - June 27, 2019**

Blank screen, but got the project set up!

**Day 2 - June 28, 2019**

Finished the tutorial. The app presents the images in a table view with interactive title. Selecting a file slides in the image with a dismissable navigation bar. Swiping left will pull back the table view.
