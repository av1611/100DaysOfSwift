I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Fireworks Night"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/20/overview). This app is designed to teach me about more of the techniques and capabilities of SpriteKit. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Fireworks Night" app

**Day 1 - July 19, 2019**

I finished the Fireworks Night app. It's pretty simple, but I was able to learn more about the logic used when creating a game and using SpriteKit.
