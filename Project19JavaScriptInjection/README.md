I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["JavaScript Injection"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/19/overview). This app is designed to teach me about extending Safari and building an app directly inside Safari's action menu. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "JavaScript Injection" app

**Day 1 - July 15, 2019**

The main focus of the app is the extension, but I went ahead and made the app portion a little more interesting by hosting a disco! So far, we set up the framework for the Safari extension, loading the first item, but the extension doesn't do anything.

** Day 2 - July 16, 2019**

I finished the app such that JavaScript code is run in a Safari extension.

I also completed the challenge problems which included adding a button to add example code. Also, the data for each website is saved and automatically loaded the next time the extension is used on the same webpage.
