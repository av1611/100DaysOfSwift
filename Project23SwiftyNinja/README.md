**Start Date: June 5, 2019  
End Date: September 13, 2019**

I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Swifty Ninja"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/23/overview). This app is a game designed to teach me about new properties of Sprite Kit including using `SKShapeNode()` to create custom shapes. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Swifty Ninja" app

**Day 1 - July 22, 2019**

I set up the app and created the first few functions. Nothing much to show except for the blank playing view.

I finished the standard gameplay. I learned a lot about the logic used to design a game including how to keep track of all the nodes, removing those out of the frame. Also, I learned how to create a path using `UIBezierPath()`.

**Day 2 - July 24, 2019**

I completed 2 of the 3 challenges in the end of the Swifty Ninja project. The first was to remove absolute frame values with those that adjust to the frame of the device. The second was to show a Game Over label.
