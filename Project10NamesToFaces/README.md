End Date: September 13, 2019**

I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Names to Faces"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/10/overview). This app will show images of people labeled with their names. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Names to Faces" app

**Day 1 - July 4, 2019**

I have set up the basics of the IB, but not far enough to build.

**Day 2 - July 5, 2019**
