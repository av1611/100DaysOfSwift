**Start Date: June 5, 2019  
End Date: September 13, 2019**

I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Guess the Flag"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/1/overview). It creates a simple game where the player must name the country that the flag represents. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Guess the Flag" app

**Day 1 - June 28, 2019**

Tappable buttons that display the first three flags in the array, but they don't do anything when tapped.

**Day 2 - June 29, 2019**

Finished app! A coutry's name is displayed at the top, and the user must click the correct flag below. Selecting the correct answer advances the score by one, and the incorrect answer reduces the score by one. The flags are shuffled and which button holds the correct answer is selected at random. The score is tracked and reported in the title of the view and the messages after each round.

**Day 3 - June 30, 2019**

(Part of Project 3) I added a button in the navigation bar that shows the current score.

**Day 4 - July 1, 2019**

As a part of learning about Auto Layout in project 6, I enabled landscape views for the game.
