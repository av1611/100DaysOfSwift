I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Marble Maze"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/26/overview). This app is designed to continue my education about game creation while introducing new concepts such as measuring acceleration of the device and implementing code only on the simulator or physical hardware. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Marble Maze" app

**Day 1 - July 25, 2019**

I have completed most of the set-up including loading level one, adding physics bodies to all neccesary components, and a player that can roll around in response to touch on the simulator or tilt on an iPad. I got a quick introduction to `CoreMotion`, too.

**Day 2 - August 10, 2019**

Finished up the standard portion of the tutorial to react to the collision of two nodes. The first task was to figure out which was the marble and then react to what the other one was (eg. if the other node is a star, the score increments by one).

**NB:** I did not finish up the challenge problems for this app because I am not too interested in game design, at the moment.
