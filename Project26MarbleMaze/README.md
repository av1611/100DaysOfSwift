I want to learn how to program in the Swift language. To this end, I will practice coding in Swift for at least one hour every day for 100 days.

This is an example iOS project produced by [*Hacking with Swift*](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read) called ["Marble Maze"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/26/overview). This app is designed to continue my education about game creation while introducing new concepts such as measuring acceleration of the device and implementing code only on the simulator or physical hardware. I will post images below of the view of the app after each day's work.

## Daily progress of "Marble Maze" app

**Day 1 - July 25, 2019**

I have completed most of the set-up including loading level one, adding physics bodies to all neccesary components, and a player that can roll around in response to touch on the simulator or tilt on an iPad. I got a quick introduction to `CoreMotion`, too.
